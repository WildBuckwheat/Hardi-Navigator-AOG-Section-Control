# Hardi-Navigator-AOG-Section-Control
 A PCB that adds AgOpenGPS section and rate control functionality to a Hardi Navigator 3000 trailed sprayer. This PCB replaces a PCB installed on the sprayer from the factory. No cutting of wires is required to install the new PCB and the sprayer can quickly be reverted to factory operation.
